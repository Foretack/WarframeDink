# WarframeDink

WarframeDink is an app that reads the log file generated by warframe and sends relevant events to Discord through a webhook.

Before launching the app, make sure to add the destination webhook, as well as a username and profile picture for the webhook in config.json. (leave username null to use in-game name)

You can download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/Foretack/WarframeDink/releases).
